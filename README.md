# Linux-Android-phone-remote
First you install qt scrcpy and mirror your phone. Then you run a Teamviewer or Remote Desktop and run the server on the Qt scrcpy window. Finally you use the 
Teamviewer remote or RDR viewer on Iphone or Android. The versatility is awesome. When I tested it only had one device it messed my computer. The reason why I came up with this is because Of my other repository Android 64 bit DTS. I needed to keep the jack plugged in for my stereo so this is what I came up with.Download is available through my Onedrive link is below. Enjoy!
